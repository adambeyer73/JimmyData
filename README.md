<h1><b>JimmyData</b></h1>

<h3>This is an android based project meant for collecting delivery driver data during a shift at Jimmy Johns. (See specification documents for list of gathered metrics)</h3>

<p>The first goal of the project is to get a set of forms created for collecting various values from the driver during their shift. Once we feel as though the data collection process is solid and error free, we will move on to working on exporting and evaulating the data.</p>
